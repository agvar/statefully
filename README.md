## 📖 About 

Statefully is a productivity app designed to help you manage not just your tasks, but your mental and emotional states. By tracking the time you spend in creative ("Flow") vs overwhelmed ("Drained") states, Statefully helps you understand your patterns and work more mindfully.

The app follows a simple workflow:
1. **Think**: Capture thoughts and feelings (voice or text input)
2. **Do**: Convert thoughts into actionable tasks with time tracking
3. **Pulse**: Visualize how you spend your time and energy

├─ 🎨 Design System

The app uses a custom design system with:

- **Color Palette**: Navy blue primary, Bronze accents, Flow (blue) and Drain (orange) states
- **Typography**: iOS-inspired scale (12px - 36px)
- **Spacing**: 8px-based system (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64)
- **Shadows**: Subtle iOS-style elevation (sm, md, lg)
- **Animations**: React Native Animated API for smooth transitions

All design tokens are centralized in [constants/theme.ts](constants/theme.ts) for consistency.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Microphone Permissions

The app requires microphone access for voice recording. Permissions are configured in:

- **iOS**: `ios.infoPlist.NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in `app.json`
- **Android**: `recordAudioAndroid: true` in `app.json`

### Deepgram API Setup

1. Sign up at [deepgram.com](https://deepgram.com/)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file
4. The app uses the `nova-3` model with smart formatting enabled

## 📝 Development Notes

- **State Management**: Zustand store persists thoughts and tasks to AsyncStorage
- **Date Handling**: Custom merge function handles Date serialization/deserialization
- **Audio Files**: Recordings saved to document directory as `.m4a` format
- **Animations**: Pulsing button uses looped parallel animations for scale and opacity
