# Copilot Instructions for Statefully Project

## My Learning Preference
I prefer **tutorial-style learning** where concepts are explained, not just implemented.

**Do NOT write complete code implementations.** Instead:
- Explain the concept first
- Show me the pattern/structure
- Explain why this approach
- Let me implement it myself

**Example:** If I ask about AudioRecorder setup, explain what each parameter does and why, then let me write the code.

## Project Context
See `Design_Summary_baseline.txt` for complete architecture.

## Key Principles
1. Explain before implementing
2. Provide learning context (why not just how)
3. Answer follow-up questions patiently
4. Assume I want to understand, not just copy-paste
